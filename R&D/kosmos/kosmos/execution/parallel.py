"""
Parallel experiment execution for improved throughput.

This module provides parallel execution of multiple experiments using:
- ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks (code execution)
- ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound tasks (API calls, database queries)
- Resource-aware scheduling to prevent system overload

Performance Impact:
- 4-8× faster for multiple experiments (N× speedup where N = CPU cores)
- Efficient resource utilization
- Automatic load balancing
